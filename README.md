# Project Information
The purpose of this Project is to build a fun and simple application that fetches and displays Pokemon data

# Pokedex
This Pokemon App allows user to search for any pokemon and add it to the captured list. The app uses the PokeAPI. Pokemon data can be fetched at https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu (Replace "pikachu" with a pokemon name or id).

# Users can search any pokemon by name or id and display it's information.
1. Front-facing image
2. Name
3. ID/Name
4. List all types associated.
5. List 4 stats. (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed)
# Capture Button
1. Pressing the "Capture" button adds the current Pokemon to the list on the right.
2. Can capture the same pokemon multiple times.
3. Can only capture up to 6 pokemon.

# Captured List
1. Displays all captured Pokemon images stacked vertically.
2. Clicking on a captured Pokemon removes it from the list.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the app dependencies and libraries.

*** Note ***
Chakra UI build (chakra-ui/react": "^2.5.1",) created 6 high severity vulnerabilities that needs to be addressed in the future.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
